# gen3_multiscale — Phase 0 frozen contract

Implements `CLAUDE_HANDOFF_MULTISCALE_SPATIAL_FIELD_ARCHITECTURES.md`'s
"Phase 0: Freeze the experiment contract" and "Phase 1: Build one shared
example object". Status: **Phase 0/1 only** — boundary-ring extraction
(Phase 2), mask-aware WSI/LongNet adaptation (Phase 3), the shared GEX/
transport gate (Phase 4), token modules (Phase 5), the four architecture
wrappers (Phase 6), losses/diagnostics (Phase 7), and configs/launcher
(Phase 8) are **not yet implemented**. This document will be extended,
not replaced, as later phases land.

## 1. Base commit

Branched from `codex/mask-aware-slide-context` at commit `fd23737`
("Precompute Architecture 4's STPath context once per sample, not every
step") — the branch's current tip at the time this document was written,
carrying every audit fix referenced by the handoff: patient-level
held-out splitting (`split_by_patient`, default `True`), cache
provenance (`model_signature`/`_cheap_file_identity`), checkpoint-resume
fixes (optimizer/RNG state, gene-identity verification, wall-clock
curriculum continuation), STPath raw-count-log1p preprocessing,
`strict_broken_region`, and the metric-naming/ST-FID stability fixes.

`gen3_multiscale/` is a **new top-level package**, developed on the same
`codex/mask-aware-slide-context` branch (per Adam's direction — no new
branch requested). It does not modify, import from, or depend on the
currently-running gen2 4-architecture training jobs' checkpoint
directories or process state in any way; those keep running unaffected.

## 2. Reused audited infrastructure (verbatim copies, not new code)

Per the handoff's "Reuse audited data hygiene and cache logic" and "Do
not copy the older fusion design blindly, and do not compare old and new
result numbers as if they came from the same protocol" — the following
are copied **verbatim** from `gen2_architectures/` (their own docstrings
now note the copy provenance and a "do not let this drift" warning):

- `data/hest1k_catalog.py` — patient-level `resolve_sample_selection`
  (including this session's cross-organ patient-conflict fix).
- `data/mask_bank.py` — mask bank persistence + `query_overlap_report`.
- `training/checkpoint.py` — save/load with optimizer+RNG state,
  `verify_gene_names` (fail-closed gene-identity check), history/
  rollback.

All 41 of these modules' existing gen2_architectures tests were copied
alongside (import paths rewritten only) and pass unmodified against the
gen3_multiscale copies — see `tests/test_hest1k_catalog.py`,
`tests/test_gene_panel_compatibility.py`, `tests/test_checkpoint.py`,
`tests/test_query_overlap_report.py`.

`src/models/hierarchical_slide.py`'s `FrozenGigaPathSlideEncoder`
(official Prov-GigaPath LongNet, mask-aware, fail-closed checkpoint
validation) and `src/models/registry.py`'s
`HierarchicalGeneTransportRegressor` (the gene-value-preserving
transport head this whole design is built around) are **not yet
copied** — they're Phase 3/4 dependencies, pulled in when those phases
start, per the staged plan agreed with Adam.

## 3. Gene panel, preprocessing, and normalization

Not yet pinned to a specific run — no training sample selection has been
resolved for gen3_multiscale yet (that happens once a real config exists,
Phase 8). The MECHANISM is fixed now: `hest1k_catalog.resolve_sample_selection`
+ `checkpoint.verify_gene_names` (both reused verbatim, §2) are the same
audited mechanism gen2_architectures uses today, so gene panel pinning,
ordering, and resume-time identity verification inherit every fix already
made to them this session with zero new code.

## 4. Mask banks and hole-size/shape stratification

`data/mask_bank.py` (reused, §2) is the persistence layer; hole
generation itself comes from `gen2_architectures/data/masking.py`'s
`random_dropout_patches`, which already supports everything Phase 0
item 7 needs without new code:

- **Size stratification**: `radius_range` per masking config, with
  `radius_unit="spot_spacing"` to keep hole size comparable across
  slides with different physical spot spacing (rather than raw
  coordinate units). Plan: generate 3 explicit tiers (small/medium/large)
  as 3 separate masking configs sharing one mask-bank naming scheme, not
  one blended distribution — so results can be reported per-stratum as
  the handoff requires ("The schedule must cover predeclared hole-size/
  shape strata; report results by the same strata").
- **Shape stratification**: `shape="circle"` (compact) vs
  `shape="mixed"` (circle/ellipse/irregular blob, randomly chosen per
  hole) already exist. Plan: circle = "compact" stratum, mixed =
  "irregular" stratum.
- **"Background" contamination is structurally impossible in this
  masking scheme**: Visium's spot grid only contains positions with real
  captured tissue to begin with (no background/off-tissue rows exist in
  `coords_xy`/`slice_ids` at all), so a hole's nominal circular footprint
  can only ever cover real spots — there is no analogue of "the hole
  extends into empty background" the way there would be for a
  pixel/WSI-space mask. What Phase 0 item 8's "natural-edge and
  tear-like masks" stress test actually needs is a hole whose center
  lands close to the tissue's own boundary (producing an asymmetric,
  bite-shaped hole once cropped to real spots) versus one well inside the
  tissue interior. That requires a "distance from hole center to the
  tissue edge" computation gen3_multiscale doesn't have yet — **deferred
  to Phase 2**, where the full per-slide spot adjacency graph (built for
  boundary-ring BFS) makes that distance a natural byproduct rather than
  a separate computation. Primary-benchmark masks for Phase 0 will use
  `center_mode="random"` (uniform over real tissue spots, the existing
  default) without an edge-distance filter; the edge-distance-stratified
  stress-test tier is a Phase 2 follow-up, not blocking Phase 0/1
  sign-off.

## 5. Query-spot overlap policy across validation/test masks

Per Phase 0 item 9 ("Prefer nonoverlapping query spots among
validation/test masks. If overlap is unavoidable, record it explicitly
and never treat those masks as independent biological replicates."):
`query_overlap_report` (reused verbatim, §2) is the measurement
mechanism, already proven in gen2_architectures this session. Not yet
customized for gen3's own mask-generation defaults — `build_mask_bank`'s
existing seed-per-index scheme does not actively avoid overlap, it only
lets it be measured after the fact. Actively minimizing overlap (e.g.
rejection-sampling a new hole against already-placed test-split holes)
is a real, separate piece of work; deferred rather than silently assumed
solved, consistent with what I told Adam about this exact gap in
gen2_architectures's own equivalent fix.

## 6. Cache signature scheme

Not yet implemented as gen3-specific code. Plan (Phase 3, when LongNet/
transport-head caching is actually built): mirror
`gen2_architectures/data/context_features.py`'s `_adata_feature_signature`
+ `data_prep._cheap_file_identity` pattern — content hash of the input
data plus an explicit `model_signature` (checkpoint path + mtime + size)
plus a versioned preprocessing-code string, exactly the discipline that
fixed two real staleness bugs earlier this session (GigaPath preprocessing
version, scFoundation checkpoint identity). No new cache-signature design
needed; only wiring once there's a real cache to protect.

## 7. Shared example object (Phase 1 — implemented)

`data/example.py` defines `SpatialFieldInputs` and `SpatialFieldTargets`
as two separate frozen dataclasses (not one dataclass with a target
field a caller could pass through by mistake) — satisfies "Model-forward
inputs must be separated from target-only fields by type and API, not
merely by convention." `validate_spatial_field_example` enforces every
structural invariant Phase 2/3's real builder will need to satisfy:
observed/query index disjointness and no duplicates, all secondary index
arrays (`query_local_neighbor_idx`, `boundary_idx`) resolve within
`observed_idx`'s range (never the raw per-slide ordering), `boundary_ring`
∈ {1, 2, 3}, non-negative depth-to-boundary, finite values everywhere,
and matching gene-panel width between observed and target arrays.
12 tests in `tests/test_example.py` cover valid construction and each
violation.

Not yet implemented: the real BUILDER that constructs a
`SpatialFieldExample` from an actual HEST-1k sample + mask bank record —
that's Phase 2 (boundary-ring BFS extraction) and Phase 3 (WSI tile
attachment), the next staged deliverables.

## 8. What Phase 0/1 does NOT cover yet

- No boundary-ring (Rings 1–3) BFS extraction — Phase 2.
- No mask-aware GigaPath LongNet adaptation — Phase 3.
- No gene-encoder ablation read/selection, no transport-head reuse — Phase 4.
- No token modules, no model code at all — Phase 5/6.
- No losses, no diagnostics, no configs, no launcher — Phase 7/8.
- No leakage/geometry/learning/numerical gate suite yet — those tests
  only become meaningful once there's a real model and a real data
  builder to test; Phase 1's tests instead cover the schema/contract
  layer those later tests will build on top of.
